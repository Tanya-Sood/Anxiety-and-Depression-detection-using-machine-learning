# Anxiety-and-Depression-detection-using-Twitter-data
This repository contains the code and resources for a research project focused on detecting anxiety and depression using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project analyzes social media data to classify users' mental health states. It leverages state-of-the-art classification algorithms and text processing methods to achieve accurate and insightful results.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning and preparing social media text data, including tokenization, stemming, and removal of noise.  
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes methods like Count vectorizer, and sentiment analysis.  
- **Classification Models:** Implementation of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest , Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boodting Machine, Adaboost and K-Nearest Neighbors for mental health classification.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for model evaluation.  
- **Visualization:** Graphical representations of classification results and feature importance.  
- **Scalability:** Modular and scalable code structure for extending to new datasets or additional mental health conditions.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python  
- Libraries: scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
